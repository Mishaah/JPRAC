Want to practice rollouts? Sacrificing for a medic pick? Sentry jumping? Pyro flare jumps? Anything involving hurting yourself to move around? 
You've found the right resource to start offline practice on any of the supported maps.

PLEASE NOTE:  I have started this project a while back and had big plans to add more features. However, plans change. Instead of letting it catch dust however, I have decided to release it AS IS. Meaning expect bugs, unimplemented features and missing support. Feel free to contribute code if you like this resource and would like to see it improved.

Features:
- Teleport with many default locations to choose from, but also restarting the round or using a custom teleport at the touch of a button!
- Heal, buff, regen ammo, gain invincibility, or choose from the supported ubers to give yourself for a given amount of time!
- Play around with a timer and objective (to place wherever you want) to reach before the timer ends!
